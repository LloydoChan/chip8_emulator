# chip8_emulator
A very simple chip 8 emulator with Rust and SDL - could do with some optimization and better organization. People are free to use this however they want!

I learned a lot not just regarding Rust but a lot of painful lessons regarding project strategy and testing for my next emulation project. Please please think about unit testing each opcode when creating your own emulation software!

Potential extensions to this project
add more cmd line args for options other than roms to load
add a dissasembler mode, present the dissasembly in a second window
add debugger functions, like being able to break at any point and set breakpoints
